# regression-using-gradient-descent

***A linear Regression Model*** is built from scratch using the ***Gradient Descent*** concept.
- The data set used for implementation is provided in the repository itself.
- Figure1 depicts the arrangement of data points in a X-Y plane
- Figure2 depicts the optimised ***Regression line*** drawn for this particular data points
- To understand *Gradient Descent* you need a have a basic knowledge of Calculus
